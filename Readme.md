# Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a DFF/Latch-based RAM, Register File and Cache custom compilation flow that utilizes standard cell libraries following a standard ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) implementation approach. Different views (HDL netlist, HDL functional models, LEF, GDS, Timing, ‚Ä¶) are all generated for a given size configuration.

The layout targets highly compact designs (85%+) as the cells are placed on the floor plan using a custom placer. Moreover, the custom placer ensures that the routing will be relatively simple. Currently, the compiler uses OpenROAD routers to route the macros with great success. 

The Compiler relies on basic building blocks to construct the layout of different RAM/RF/Cache configurations. Check [the compiler documentation](./docs/) for more info. The following shows how a 32x32 memory (DFF based) is constructed.

The generated layouts by the DFFRAM compilers for RAM32 as well as its building blocks are as follows:
- BYTE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="./docs/img/byte_all_layers.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/> 
- WORD (32-bit)
![A Word; placed and routed, metal only, no outline](./docs/img/word_metal_only_no_outline.png)

- RAM8 (32x8)
![8 Words; placed and routed](./docs/img/8_routed_all_layers.png)

- RAM32 (32x32)
![32 Words; placed and routed](./docs/img/32_routed_all_layers.png)


Currently, the can compiler generate the layout of the following configurations:
- RAM
  - 32 words with byte write enable (1RW and 1RW1R).
  - 128 words with byte write enable (1RW and 1RW1R).
  - 256 words with byte write enable (1RW and 1RW1R).
  - 512 words with byte write enable (1RW and 1RW1R).
  - 1024 words with byte write enable (1RW and 1RW1R).
  - 2048 words with byte write enable (1RW and 1RW1R).
- Register File
  - 32 x 32-bit words (2R1W)

The layout of 2048x32 (8 Kbytes) RAM as generated by the compiler is shown below:

The [`OpenLane/`](./OpenLane) folder will contain good known OpenLane configurations to build DFFRAM different macros.

<sup>1</sup> All support 32-bit word reads and 1, 2, and 4 bytes writes.  
<sup>2</sup> Values are based on the original layout produced by the compiler. OpenRAM macros are typically wrapped to be useful w/ automated PnR ASIC flows.
