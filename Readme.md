# Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a DFF/Latch-based RAM, Register File and Cache custom compilation flow that utilizes standard cell libraries following a standard ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) implementation approach. Different views (HDL netlist, HDL functional models, LEF, GDS, Timing, …) are all generated for a given size configuration.

The layout generated from the compiler is highly compact (95%+ placement density) as the cells are placed on the floor plan using a custom placer. Moreover, the custom placer ensures that the routing will be relatively simple. Currently, the compiler uses OpenROAD routers to route the macros with great success. 

*Note: The project will consider the creation of a custom router if automatic routing using open-source global and detailed routers do not give good results, though, they are, so far.*

The Compiler relies on basic building blocks to construct the layout of different RAM/RF/Cache configurations. Check [the compiler documentation](./docs/Compiler.md) for more info. The following shows how a 32x32 memory (DFF based) is constructed.

The generated layouts by the DFFRAM compilers for RAM32 as well as its building blocks are as follows:
- BYTE

- WORD (32-bit)
![A Word; placed and routed, metal only, no outline](./docs/img/word_metal_only_no_outline.png)

- RAM8 (32x8)
![8 Words; placed and routed](./docs/img/8_routed_all_layers.png)

- RAM32 (32x32)
![32 Words; placed and routed](./docs/img/32_routed_all_layers.png)


Currently, the can compiler generate the layout of the following configurations:
- RAM
  - 32 words with byte write enable (1RW and 1RW1R).
  - 128 words with byte write enable (1RW and 1RW1R).
  - 256 words with byte write enable (1RW and 1RW1R).
  - 512 words with byte write enable (1RW).
  - 1024 words with byte write enable (1RW).
  - 2048 words with byte write enable (1RW).
- Register File
  - 32x32 (2R1W)

The layout of 2048x32 (8 Kbytes) RAM as generated by the compiler is shown below:

The [`OpenLane/`](./OpenLane) folder will contain good known OpenLane configurations to build DFFRAM different macros.

<sup>1</sup> All support 32-bit word reads and 1, 2, and 4 bytes writes.  
<sup>2</sup> Values are based on the original layout produced by the compiler. OpenRAM macros are typically wrapped to be useful w/ automated PnR ASIC flows.
